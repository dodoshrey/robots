# robots
A creative react app which filters a given list of robots and a click counter added at the end.

Installation:
1. Clone project
2. run npm install
3. run npm start

There are 2 folders in src folder.
1. components
2. containers

In components folder, I have made different components for the react app which are furthur used by the App.
In container folder, I have made App.js which imports all the components from its respective folder and then by using JSX I have made this creative and basic project.
