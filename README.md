# robots
A creative react app which filters a given list of robots

There are 2 folders in src folder.
1. components
2. containers

In components folder, I have made different components for the react app which are furthur used by the App.
In container folder, I have made App.js which imports all the components from its respective folder and then by using JSX I have made this creative and basic project.
